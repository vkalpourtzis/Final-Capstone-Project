# Final-Capstone-Project
Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

## Introduction / Business Problem

Instead of huge globalization, there is a prospect that the downtown of Athens may miss something.
